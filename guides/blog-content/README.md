# General Guide
Welcome! Since you're viewing this document, we assume you're looking for a guide on how to get started contributing your article(s)/content(s) to the AWS Community Blog.

<br>
<br>

### Content Creation
This is a community blog. Every content contribution is expected to be **unique** and **up-to-date**.

> When writing an article which talks about certain commands and syntax, please specify which version you are using (ie. Python2.7 vs Python3.7).

As the Community Blog is written via Markdown, we expect that elements are well-utilized. 

- Proper selection of a blog title
- Use **BOLD** text properly
- Use `hylighted` text for file names
- Use ```CODE BLOCKS``` for sample codes
- Use images and assign proper sizes

    - Anything that talks about AWS Service Architecture
    - Anything that talks about AWS Services How-Tos
- Business Related Articles

    - Anything that talks about Business Partnerships with AWS Cloud
- AWS Community Stories (AWS User-Groups)
    - Anything that relates to AWS User-Groups

    - Anything that relates to anyone's AWS journey

### Content Branding
Content Branding is very important for us in moderating every content contribution, this is to make sure that the Community Blog doesn't get abused by anyone who is looking for a good avenue to make a PR (Public Relations).

What do we consider for branding?

- Unlimited mentioning of the Business/Personal Name but only one instance should have an external `hyperlink` redirecting to their official site
- As much as possible, we avoid having external links to the Community Blog (coming from other website blogs/video). However, if the external content is really exceptional -- we will take considerations. We always observe safety as our main priority. Protecting everyone from those who will try to use this medium in spreading exploits via public domain is on the top of our list. Aside from security we have to make sure we don't promote 404s redirecting people to a deadlink (from the external links)
    - Content approval will be done by the governing body, [Blog Moderators](../blog-moderation/README.md)
- Content owner can use images alongside with the context. However, please be aware of those Â© **Copy Righted** materials
    - If you plan to have AWS Services logo in your article, [official images are here](../blog-images/aws-services-logo/README.md)
    - If you plan to have AWS User-Group logo in your article, [official images are here](../blog-images/aws-usergroup-logo/README.md)

### Content Ownership
As the content gets approved and published on the AWS Community Blog, the article ownership automatically gets changed to _community_, thus making it a collective intellectual property. Meanwhile, you will still be mentioned as the **Author** of the blog post.

Also, when a content gets approved and published, it is expected that your content gets translated to different languages like Indonesian, Chinesse, Malaysian, Vietnamese and other languages. This is the main reason why the ownership will have to be under the _community_ as it will be a collective effort from the original Authors and the Translators.
